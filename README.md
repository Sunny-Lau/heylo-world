# Introduction

This is my personal blog for sharing some technical tips and tutorials. Hope this will help you conquering some problems.

Currently, I have plan to write some intro level tutorial about AWS and Django REST framework, which I am very familiar with. Also, I'll share some useful open source projects and related instruction.
